In Loving Memory: A Memorial Website for My Mother
About This Project

This project is a tribute and memorial website dedicated to the loving memory of my dear mother, Dorothy P Carty. Through this website, I wanted to honor her life, share her story, and create a digital space where friends and family could gather to remember her.
Technology and Journey

When I embarked on this project, I had little to no coding experience. I built this memorial website entirely in HTML, using the limited knowledge I had at the time. I didn't know about platforms like WordPress, so I learned the basics of HTML step by step.

I pieced together each section of the website, from the main page that tells her story to the photo gallery that captures beautiful moments. The process was a learning journey for me, as I gradually discovered how to structure a webpage, add images, and even include simple styling using CSS.
A Labor of Love

Creating this website was a deeply personal experience. It allowed me to express my love and gratitude for my mother while learning valuable skills along the way. Each line of code represents not only my dedication to the project but also my enduring love for her.
How to Contribute

This project is a tribute from the heart, and its purpose is to celebrate my mother's life. While I don't anticipate many contributions, if you have any ideas or suggestions to improve the website, please feel free to reach out.
